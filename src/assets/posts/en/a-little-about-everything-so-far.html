                    <p>The Project Green Goblin was started in 2024, but the initial idea was a little different.</p>
                    <p>Born was a resource manager mobile game, the idea soon change and came to a more complete adventure in a fantastic world.</p>
                    <p>The original ideia stay there yet, even though now, we travel many other ways.</p>

                    <p>Just to context about who be writing to you. I Started to studied game developer from this projet. I’m falling in love and think I found the job of my dreams.</p>
                    <p>I’m graduated in Cience of Computer, and I have been work with development for 11 years.</p>
                    <p>I was participated a lot of projects. From Backend to Frontend.</p>
                    <p>To complement the gaming area, I can say that I am also a game designer. Moreover I was owner of a fisical Escape Game, and developed some rooms and puzzle games.</p>
                    <p>And finally, I’m also writer, having a finished book in pre-publishing process, however, currently, my efforts and my heart are here.</p>

                    <p>A sandbox that mixes resource management with adventure RPG, came stealth mechanicals, character progression and a lot of other things.</p>
                    <p>Is a little hard to label, because to me it like a original thing, even so, I think that this description transmit the main idea.</p>
                    <p>In game, we follow a Goblin that want to get rich with his shop, in a prejudiced, but full of histories capital. However, the little green big-eared, has a secret who prefer not spread: He is a Dungeon Master too, and needs strive to make his dungeons keep the wheel spin.</p>

                    <p>We don’t have a name to our charismatic goblin yet. The truth is that we don't even have a 3D model defined. What we have, at the moment, more elaborated, is his background, some of his personalities traits and his skills. But that will be for another post.</p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                <p>We already have a few things implemented during the first months. I can proudly say that my strong suit is programming, and because of that, some game mechanics are already in place, mainly management-related mechanics.</p>
                <p>Obviously, nothing is set in stone and everything can change. But I do feel a certain pride in many lines of code.</p>
                <p>I’ve allowed myself the luxury of working on several fronts, jumping back and forth between different parts of the game. Because of that, I can say that I’ve not only started the logic and programming, but also began working on level design, animations, and character controls.</p>
                <p>Right now, I’m working on the inventory and have also made great progress on some important menus.</p>
                <p>The choice of art style and assets has already been defined, and the initial scope for the map seems fine in my head.</p>
                <p>The main mechanics are already mapped out and, as I mentioned before, some of them are already implemented.</p>
                <p>Of course, this is just a summary of the development so far, and the idea is to bring separate posts not only for new chapters, but also to show and dive deeper into the development of the things I’ve already gone through. After all, those two weeks I spent solving the cursed stair movement definitely deserve a post of their own.</p>
